# Johnny See
Full Stack Web Developer who love to code in React and build complex web applications using modern technologies.

Latest project was a Slow Food App where customer can add food to a cart, but in order to checkout the customer needs to sign in and get an authorization via APIs from the backend server.

Before I discovered how interesting and exciting programming can be, I have been working as a Wiring Diagram Designer within the Automotive Industry in Gothenburg for 3.5 years. I have a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from Link√∂ping University.

In my free time I enjoy to code, spend time with family and play padel.

Looking forward to connect and have a chat!
