Before I discovered how interesting and exciting programming can be, I have been working as a Wiring Diagram Designer within the Automotive Industry in Gothenburg for 3.5 years. I have a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from Link√∂ping University.

In my free time I enjoy to code, spend time with family and play padel.

Looking forward to connect and have a chat!
